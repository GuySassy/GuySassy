## üî¨ Key Projects
Here are a few projects that highlight my skills and interests:

### 1. **[GPTbyPBB](https://github.com/GuySassy/GPTbyPBB)** (Finished)
   - **Description**: MSc research project. Implemented a PAC-Bayes bound optimization approach, enhancing a GPT model through Block Diagonal parameterization. Experiments made both for training from scratch (nanoGPTbyPBB) and LLM finetune (LoRAbyPBB).
   - **Technologies**: PAC-Bayes theory, Transformers, LLM peft with LoRA.
   - **Highlights**: Improved performance by incorporating PAC-Bayes bounds with unique parameterization strategies. Developed a Self-Certified and certainty aware GPT.

### 2. **[Stocks Algorithmic Trading](https://github.com/GuySassy/AlgoTrade)** (In progress)
   - **Description**: Developed a predictive model for stocks prices.
   - **Technologies**: Machine Learning, Data Fusion, PyTorch, Transformers, VAE
   - **Highlights**: Improved predictive accuracy by integrating temporal and environmental data.

### 3. **[Multi-Agent Q-Learning Environment](https://github.com/GuySassy/TheMind)** (In progress)
   - **Description**: Designed a multi-agent environment for cooperative learning in Gym, with agents using Q-learning to optimize task ordering.
   - **Technologies**: Python, Gym, Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks
   - **Highlights**: Integrated a complex reward system to drive agents toward cooperative behavior.
